# Election Audit
## Overview of the Election Audit
The names of the three candidates from the recent congressional election along with the number and percentage of votes received were provided to the election commission a short time ago.  These results also named the winner of the election. After receiving this information, the election commission requested the following additional information:
-	The voter turnout for each county.
